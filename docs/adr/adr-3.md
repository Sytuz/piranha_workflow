# Decision Record #3 - Kanban Board for Development (15-05-2025)

## Status: Accepted

## Summary
> *In the context of **the development of the project**, we decided for **the use of a Kanban board** to achieve **visualization, flexibility, and continuous improvement**, accepting **the need for discipline in maintaining the board**.*

## Context
As a team with multiple developers, we needed a way to manage our development process and track the progress of tasks. We considered several options, including:
- Scrum, which involves time-boxed sprints and a defined set of roles and ceremonies. (Jira)
- Kanban, which focuses on visualizing the workflow and limiting work in progress. (GitHub Projects)
- Trello, which is a simple and flexible tool for managing tasks and projects.

The team discussed the pros and cons of each option, considering factors such as ease of use, flexibility, and the need for discipline in maintaining the board. We found that while Scrum provides a structured approach, it didn't allow for the flexibility we needed in the short timeframe of our project. Trello was also considered, but we felt that due to inexperience with the tool, it would be better to use a more integrated solution like GitHub Projects.

## Decision

We have decided to use a Kanban board for managing our development process. This decision is based on the following reasons:
- **Visualization**: A Kanban board provides a clear visual representation of the workflow, making it easy to see the status of tasks and identify bottlenecks.
- **Flexibility**: Kanban allows for continuous flow and does not require time-boxed sprints, making it easier to adapt to changing priorities and requirements.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Kanban encourages teams to continuously improve their processes and workflows, allowing for ongoing optimization and efficiency gains.
- **Trade-off**: While using a Kanban board requires discipline in maintaining the board and ensuring that tasks are updated regularly, we believe that the benefits of visualization and flexibility outweigh the downsides. We will need to establish guidelines for maintaining the board and ensuring that tasks are updated regularly.

## Consequences
- We will implement a Kanban board using GitHub Projects to manage our development process.
- We will need to establish guidelines for maintaining the board and ensuring that tasks are updated regularly.
- We will encourage team members to use the board as a tool for collaboration and communication, ensuring that everyone is aware of the status of tasks and any blockers.
