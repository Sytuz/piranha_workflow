# Scenario 2: Editorial Workflows & Content Approvals 

This document is a copy of the chosen scenario for this project. It serves to isolate the scenario from the rest of the assignment, and also so that Copilot can process it (PDF files are not supported by Copilot, at least in Agent mode).

## Vision & Strategic Goals 
- Vision: Become a leader in editorially driven content management by offering advanced approval workflows and governance features for large teams. 
- Strategic Goals:
    1. Introduce multi-stage content states and permissions, giving organizations fine-grained control over publishing. 
    2.  Streamline the handoff from creators to reviewers, legal teams, and final approvers, in custom tailored flows. 
    3.  Maintain high performance even with large editorial teams simultaneously creating and publishing content.
